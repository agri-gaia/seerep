## Liability for content

As a service provider, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz GmbH (DFKI) is responsible under general
law for its own content published on this website in accordance with Section 7 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).

DFKI makes every effort to keep the information on our website accurate and current, nevertheless, errors and
uncertainties cannot be entirely ruled out. For this reason, DFKI undertakes no liability for ensuring that the provided
information is current, accurate or complete, and is not responsible for its quality. DFKI is not liable for material or
immaterial damages caused directly or indirectly by the use or non-use of the offered information, or by the use of
erroneous and incomplete information, unless willful or grossly negligent fault can be demonstrated. This also applies
with respect to software or data provided for download.

DFKI reserves the right to modify, expand or delete parts of the website or the entire website without separate
announcement, or to cease publication temporarily or definitively.

## Liability for links

Pursuant to Section 7 para. 1 of TMG (German Tele-Media Act), the law limits our responsibility as a service provider
to our own content on this website. According to Sections 8 – 10 TMG, we are not obliged to permanently monitor any
transmitted or stored third-party information, nor to investigate circumstances that might indicate illegal activity.
This does not affect our obligation to remove or block information according to general law. However, we can only assume
liability for such data from the point in time at which a concrete legal infringement has been identified. Upon
notification of any such legal infringement, we will immediately delete the infringing content.

Cross-references (“links”) to the content providers are to be distinguished from our own content. Our offer includes
links to external third-party websites. Providers or operators of linked external pages are always responsible for their
respective content. We cannot assume any liability for the content of the linked pages. This third-party content was
checked by DFKI when the links were first set up to determine whether any legal infringements existed. At the time of
the check, no legal infringements were apparent. However, it cannot be ruled out that the content is subsequently
changed by the respective providers. A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without
evidence of a legal infringement. Should you believe that the linked external pages infringe applicable law or otherwise
contain inappropriate content, please notify us directly at: info@dfki.de.

In case DFKI should notice or receive any indication that an external offer to which it has linked might cause civil or
criminal liability, DFKI will immediately delete this link.

## Copyright

The layout of the homepage, the graphics used and other content on the DFKI website are protected by copyright. The
reproduction, processing, distribution and any type of use outside the boundaries of copyright law require the prior
written approval of the DFKI. Insofar as any content on this page was not created by DFKI, the copyrights of third
parties will be respected. If you believe that you discovered a copyright infringement, please report this to us
accordingly. Upon becoming aware of any legal infringements, DFKI will remove or disable access to such infringing
content immediately.
