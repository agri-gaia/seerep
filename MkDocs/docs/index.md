The objective of **SEEREP** (SEmantic Environment REPresentation) is to store
generated robot data and enable fast spatio-temporal-semantic queries over the
data.

## Context

Autonomous robotic systems must be aware of their environment, in order to
safely achieve their goal-oriented actions. Especially in unstructured and
changing environments, a detailed model of the environment is required for
reasoning and planning.

The sensors of a robot provide **spatial information** via the robot's pose,
**temporal information** is created by the point in time when a sensor is read.
**Semantic information** always exists implicitly and can be made explicit by
algorithms or manual labeling.

Most existing environment representations focus on one or two of these
information types, SEEREP is able to store all three. Thereby, SEEREP enables
the robot is able to reason on a higher level and disambiguate sensor data based
on the context.

## Core Features

- Fast spatio-temporal-semantic queries with
  [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/).
- Storage of data generated by the robotic system:
       - Offline on the robot (no or slow internet connection).
       - Online on a server-cluster, with
        [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/).
- Shifting computation loads away from the robot and into the cloud.
- Easily switch between [Protocol Buffers
  (PB)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) /
  [Flatbuffers (FB)](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) as the messaging
  format.

## Architecture

The following graphic provides a broad overview of the different components of
SEEREP. The sensor data along with processing results and annotations are stored
in HDF5 files. SEEREP uses **projects** to group common information (e.g. a
scanning campaign). The data can be saved locally on the robot or sent into the
cloud with gRPC. Due to that, the computation load on the robot can be reduced
and algorithms can fetch the data subset which they actually need.
